# BeautifyRuby

Beautifies Ruby code. This plugin uses the [Ruby Script Beautifier](http://www.arachnoid.com/ruby/rubyBeautifier.html) written by P.Lotus

I made very little modification to get it to work with a Sublime Text 2 plugin.

### Key Binding

```
  cmd + k
```

### Installation
Install this plugin using [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), a
package manager for Sublime Text 2.

In Sublime Text 2, press "cmd + shift + p" and then type "install".

Once you see "Package Control: Install Package", enter.

When the packages load, another selection window will appear. Type

BeautifyRuby and enter. All done!
